            The 1933 Crash in Lombardy, Italy</a><br/>
			Transcript (1933 Lombardy, Italy Crashed Spaceship)<br/>
            With the threat of war casting an ominous shadow across Europe, an incredible series of 
			events unfolds, all under the supervision of one of history's most powerful and feared 
			leaders, Benito Mussolini.</p>
            <p>[Nick Pope] In 1933, it's claimed that a UFO crashed in the Lombardy region of Italy. 
			This was apparently an object around 50 feet in diameter, like two saucers joined together. 
			It was described as being grayish in color, and metallic. And apparently, it was then taken 
			by the military and studied on the personal orders of the then-dictator Benito Mussolini.</p>
            <p>[narrator] According to some accounts, the UFO crashed near the city of Magenta, just 80 
			miles northeast of Mount Musinè. The craft was found to be unoccupied, and unlocking its 
			secrets became a top priority. This flying saucer was something that the Mussolini government 
			took a lot of interest in. And so there was an establishment of a group of experts to study 
			this phenomenon. To study exactly what it involved, who made it. And this committee was 
			called RS/33.</p>
            <p>[narrator] To lead the committee, it is said that Mussolini enlisted the noted engineer 
			and famed inventor of the radio, Guglielmo Marconi. Mussolini said, "Find out what it is, 
			and because it seems to be so advanced, build one." And Marconi apparently said, "Well, we 
			can't. We can't figure it out. There is a technology here over and above anything we possess." 
			And that only left the conclusion that this, for want of a better term, was an extraterrestrial 
			spacecraft.</p>
            <p>[narrator] Was a crashed extraterrestrial craft really recovered by the Italian government 
			in 1933? And if so, is it merely coincidence that it happened so close to Mount Musinè? Let's 
			just suppose that the common thread here is actually Earth energies... which the UFOs know 
			about and use, perhaps, to draw the energy that they need. So, might we be dealing with not 
			just visitation, but a more permanent facility? [Martell] When we look at Mount Musinè and 
			this energy, we wonder if there isn't something happening below ground as well. Could this be 
			a location of some type of secret base?</p>
            <p>[narrator] A secret alien base? Could this be the reason why so many strange events have 
			been reported in this area for centuries? And might it also explain what happened to the 
			lost city? Does it still exist inside the mountain?</p>

            '42-'44: The Foo Fighters (2:21)</a><br/>
			<b>Richard Dolan</b>: November, 1944. 
            One of the early interesting Foo Fire reports comes from the 415th Night Fighter 
			Squadron. They're flying missions over northeastern France. That's not far from 
			Germany. And this is still in Nazi-occupied part of France where you've got a 
			number of lights--eight, 10, 12 lights coming in on the left of the aircraft group 
			that are apparently maneuvering in a very unusual way, and then just take off at a 
			very high rate of speed. This type of thing was reported many times.</p>
            <p><b>Jacques Vallee</b>: The pilots often described these objects were sort of fuzzy 
			lights that could be a plasma light that would come up from the ground towards the 
			airplane. And we know that now, because there have been re-investigations of all the 
			flights. At the time, of course, there was no Air Force. There was the Army Air Force. 
			They were taking reports from pilots very, very seriously, because if there was a new 
			German weapon, all the pilots needed to know about it and they needed to think about 
			evasive action. These objects were called different things at the time before they got 
			a name, and the name that stuck was Foo Fighters. And it comes from a comic strip that 
			was popular at the time called "Smokey Stover." And he had a saying which was, where 
			there's a Foo, there's fire. The US government has never offered an explanation for the 
			Foo Fighters. We know that the OSS, which was the precursor of the CIA, investigated. 
			We know that British intelligence investigated this. And we don't have conclusions.</p>
            <p><b>Dr. Hynek</b>, he was just as puzzled as, I think, anybody else. My father would 
			refer to the Foo Fighters as sort of an example of something that they're something 
			fairly serious that we should look into. Or, you know, it's worthy of investigation, 
			at least it supports the idea that there's something going on that we don't understand 
			or we should look into.</p>

          <p>This was the first post-World War II sighting in the United States that garnered

            Jul'47: RAAF Captures Flying Saucer on Ranch in Roswell Region</a><br/>
			The intelligence office of the 509th Bombardment group at Roswell Army Air Field announced 
			at noon today, that the field has come into possession of a flying saucer.</p>
          <p>According to information released by the department, over authority of Maj. J. A. Marcel, 
  		    intelligence officer, the disk was recovered on a ranch in the Roswell vicinity, after an 
		    unidentified rancher had notified Sheriff Geo. Wilcox, here, that he had found the instrument 
		    on his premises.</p>
          <p>Major Marcel and a detail from his department went to the ranch and recovered the disk, 
		    it was stated.</p>
          <p>After the intelligence office here had inspected the instrument it was flown to "higher 
		    headquarters."</p>
          <p>The intelligence office stated that no details of the saucer's construction or its 
		    appearance had been revealed.</p>
          <p>Mr. and Mrs. Dan Wilmot apparently were the only persons in Roswell who have seen what 
		    they thought was a flying disk.</p>
          <p>They were sitting on their porch at 105 South Penn. last Wednesday night at about ten 
		    minutes before ten o'clock when a large glowing object zoomed out of the sky from the 
			southeast, going in a northwesterly direction at a high rate of speed.</p>
          <p>Wilmot called Mrs. Wilmot's attention to it and both ran down into the yard to watch. 
		    It was in sight less then a minute, perhaps 40 or 50 seconds, Wilmot estimated.</p>
          <p>Wilmot said that it appeared to him to be about 1,500 feet high and going fast. He 
		    estimated between 400 and 500 miles per hour.</p>
          <p>In appearance it looked oval in shape like two inverted saucers, faced mouth to mouth, 
		    or like two old type washbowls placed together in the same fashion. The entire body 
			glowed as though light were showing through from inside, though not like it would be 
			if a light were merely underneath.</p>
          <p>From where he stood Wilmot said that the object looked to be about 5 feet in size, and 
		    making allowance for the distance it was from town he figured that it must have been 15 
			or 20 feet in diameter, though this was just a guess.</p>
          <p>Wilmot said that he heard no sound but that Mrs. Wilmot said she heard a swishing sound 
		    for a very short time.</p>
          <p>The object came into view from the southeast and disappeared over the treetops in the 
		    general vicinity of six-mile hill.</p>
          <p>Wilmot, who is one of the most respected and reliable citizens in town, kept the story 
		    to himself hoping that someone else would come out and tell about having seen one, but 
			finally today decided that he would go ahead and tell about seeing it. The announcement 
			that the RAAF was in possession of one came only a few minutes after he decided to release 
			the details of what he had seen.</p>

            1971, October 5 — Early morning. While on the downwind leg of the pattern to runway 20L 
            at the Santos Dumont Airport in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, four pilots on board a single-
            engine Cessna airplane watch as a “huge star” approaches them on their starboard side. 
            The object descends to their altitude and slows rapidly to their air speed, smoothly 
            changing its direction to fly parallel with them at an estimated distance of 98 feet. 
            It looks like an “inverted dish” with a small rounded protrusion centered on its upper 
            surface that seems to contain oval windows. What appears to be the head of a person is 
            seen in one window looking at them. The UFO is seen for about 85 seconds. The object 
            descends at high velocity toward the water’s surface, turns sharply left without any 
            hesitation and disappears from sight in several seconds. The reporting witness is 
            Chief Flight Instructor José Américo C. Medeiros, 23, pilot of the Cessna.</p>

            '89-'90: Belgian UFO Wave</a><br/>
          Rare interview by Tony Dodd with a Belgian F-16 fighter jet pilot concerning the chase 
          of a triangular UFO in the skies over Belgium in 1990.</p>
          <p>Triangular UFO witnessed by hundreds of people in Belgium between November 1989 and 
          April 1990.</p>
          <p>"The events of November 29 would be documented by no less than thirty different groups 
          of witnesses, and three separate groups of police officers. All of the reports described 
          a large object flying at low altitude. The craft was of a flat, triangular shape, with 
          lights underneath.</p>
          <p>This giant craft made not a sound as it slowly and fearlessly moved across the 
          landscape of Belgium. There was free sharing of information as the Belgian populace 
          tracked this craft as it moved from the town of Liege to the border of the Netherlands 
          and Germany.</p>
          <p>This first startling sighting would evolve into a wave over the next several months. 
          On two occasions, a pair of F-16 fighters chased the mysterious object, but to no avail.</p>
          <p>On March 30, 1990, a frantic call to military headquarters came from a Belgian national 
          police Captain.</p>
          <p>He marveled at a giant triangle passing over and simultaneously two ground radar stations 
          were reporting an object of unknown origin on their screens.</p>
          <p>One of these bases was NATO controlled near the city of Glons, southeast of Brussels.</p>
          <p>After contacting other radar facilities, they learned that at least four other stations 
          were also reporting the object on their screens. The object was moving across their screens 
          slowly, and failed to send a transponder signal to identify itself.</p>
          <p>Two F-16s were ordered to intercept and identify this phenomenon, and one of the jet's 
          radars locked the object in. It appeared as a small diamond on the pilot's screen.</p>
          <p>The pilot reported that only a few seconds after locking on the target, the object began 
          to pick up speed, quickly moving out of radar range.</p>
          <p>An hour long chase ensued, during which time the F-16s picked up the strange craft's 
          signal two additional times, only to see it fade from view.</p>
          <p>The triangular craft seemed to be playing a cat and mouse game, and finally was lost in
